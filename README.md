# HoopUp

The HoopUp website locates nearby pickup basketball games and groups of people wanting to play letting you to connect and play basketball.

## Why?

I grew up playing basketball with a few friends and the games we played were always a smaller alternative to actual basketball because we never had more people.  People at the courts were almost always in a different age group than ours or simply didnt want to play an actual game.  I know many people of all ages who have the same struggle today, so I set out to create a platform where users of all ages can search for nearby courts, communicate with players around the area through the community blog, and post events/games.
